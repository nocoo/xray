# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Add automated release script

### Fixed
- Remove non-null assertions in release script
- Resolve all 21 eslint errors for zero-tolerance L2 lint

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-15

### Refactored

- **Remove dead code** — deleted unused `auth-context.ts`, `useMutation` hook, `createE2EDb()`, and 4 dead chart/palette exports
- **Extract shared utilities** — consolidated duplicate functions into single shared implementations:
  - `formatCount` (4 copies → 1 in `utils.ts`)
  - `formatTimeAgo` (4 copies → 1 in `utils.ts`, with `compact`/`long`/`coarse` style variants)
  - `estimateTweetHeight` (2 copies → 1 in `utils.ts`)
  - `pMap` (2 copies → 1 in `utils.ts`)
  - `sseMessage` (2 copies → 1 in `api-helpers.ts`)
  - `maskSecret` (2 copies → 1 in `crypto.ts`, with `prefix`/`tail` mode parameter)
  - `formatDate` (2 copies → 1 in `utils.ts`)

### Fixed

- **AI key masking security** — restored conservative tail-only masking for API keys in AI settings (only last 4 chars visible), preventing the prefix exposure introduced by the maskSecret consolidation

### Tests

- 35 new tests covering all extracted shared utilities (`formatCount`, `formatTimeAgo` × 3 styles, `formatDate`, `estimateTweetHeight`, `pMap`, `maskSecret` × 2 modes)

### Docs

- Removed stale `useMutation` references from README, CHANGELOG, and architecture docs

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Remove button on post cards** — each post card now has a trash icon button (right-aligned, red hover) that deletes the post via `DELETE /api/watchlists/[id]/posts?postId=N` and removes it from the UI instantly
- **90-day retention option** — watchlist settings now support 90-day post retention in addition to the existing 1/3/7/15/30-day options
- **Rich translation progress** — translation pipeline rewritten with sliding-window concurrency and live SSE previews; new `start` and `translating` events provide real-time feedback before each translation completes

### Fixed

- **"Translating 0/0" flash** — eliminated the brief zero-count display that appeared at the start of batch translation
- **`getDb()` test conflict** — resolved module-level database initialization conflict that caused test failures when importing from `@/db`

### Tests

- 8 new `parseSSEBuffer` unit tests covering chunked streaming and edge cases
- 5 new DELETE endpoint API tests (success, 404, 400, cross-watchlist rejection)
- 3 new `deleteById` DB repository tests
- 90-day retention acceptance test
- 7 new route tests for settings and posts endpoints

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **vinext 0.0.21 upgrade** — 12 versions of fixes from vinext 0.0.9, improving RSC compatibility, font handling, and route handler stability

### Changed

- **lucide-react 0.575.0 → 0.577.0** — icon library patch upgrade
- **Semver ranges tightened** — `typescript` narrowed from `^5.0.0` to `^5.9.3`, `vite` from `^7.0.0` to `^7.3.1` to match installed versions
- **Unused dependencies removed** — `@auth/drizzle-adapter`, `zod`, and `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` dropped from package.json

### Fixed

### Documentation

- README updated with new preview image and refreshed feature list
- TweAPI acknowledgement added to README

### Housekeeping

- Removed one-time migration script (`migrate-profiles.ts`)
- Cleaned up `.bfg-report/` artifacts and added pattern to `.gitignore`

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Masonry column breakpoints** — evenly spaced 3/4/5-col breakpoints at 512px intervals (1024/1536/2048) for balanced coverage across screen sizes; raised tall-screen bonus threshold to 5+ base cols so that the 4-column range is no longer skipped

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Unified TweetCard action bar** — every tweet card now displays a consistent bottom bar with Open (external link), Translate (inline 信达雅), and zhe.to Save buttons; replaces per-page ad-hoc actions
- **Generic `/api/translate` endpoint** — standalone translation route for any tweet by ID, decoupled from the watchlist pipeline
- **Linkify tweet text** — URLs in tweet text (t.co and other https links) are now clickable with external link styling
- **Photo hover zoom overlay** — magnifying glass icon appears on hover over photo grid items
- **Quoted tweet author clickable** — quoted tweet author name and avatar now link to the user's X profile with external link icon
- **Masonry layout for bookmarks & likes** — bookmarks and likes pages now use the shared `MasonryGrid` component for responsive column layout
- **Batch edit mode for groups** — group detail page supports multi-select members with batch delete
- **`followers.js` export format** — twitter export parser now supports `followers.js` in addition to `following.js`
- **User-paced batch resolution** — import dialog uses cooldown timer between batches and deduplicates by `twitterId` to avoid redundant API calls

### Changed

- **`(dashboard)` route group** — all authenticated pages moved into `src/app/(dashboard)/` with a shared `layout.tsx` and `useBreadcrumbs` hook, replacing per-page `<AppShell>` wrappers
- **WatchlistPostCard simplified** — delegates rendering and action bar entirely to `TweetCard`, reducing the component to a thin wrapper
- **Tweet type badges relocated** — Reply, Quote, and Retweet badges moved from inline to the card's top-right corner
- **Author row streamlined** — external link icon removed from the tweet card author row (now available in the action bar)
- **Watchlist header compressed** — 5-zone header consolidated into a single toolbar row

### Fixed

- **Route group import paths** — 15 TypeScript errors across 10 files from the `(dashboard)` migration; all `shared/types` relative imports updated for the extra nesting level, and `@/app/watchlist/` alias corrected to `@/app/(dashboard)/watchlist/`
- **Watchlist member CRUD reactivity** — member add/edit/delete now uses local state updates instead of triggering a full page reload
- **Twitter export parser** — handles unquoted JS keys, trailing commas, and numeric IDs (resolves to real usernames before import)
- **Import dedup** — pre-filters export IDs against existing group members to skip already-imported users
- **Batch resolve stability** — reduced batch size to 10, added `AbortController` for instant cancel, removed drop zone opacity flash

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Activity assessment columns** — Groups detail table now displays Likes, Last Tweet (relative time), and Activity badge (🟢 Active / 🟡 Low / 🔴 Inactive / — Unknown) computed from tweet recency and frequency
- **Enhanced Tweets column** — shows tweet count with average tweets/day calculated from account age
- **Last tweet tracking** — `last_tweet_at` column added to `twitter_profiles` table; populated during profile refresh by fetching the user's most recent tweet via `fetchUserTweets`
- **Add Members page** — dedicated `/groups/[id]/add` page with 3-tab import flow: From Account (fetch following list), Manual (paste usernames), and Import File (drag-and-drop `following.js`)

### Changed

- **Groups detail table enriched** — profile avatars link to X profiles; @username and display name are clickable; Added column right-aligned; User header left-aligned
- **Streaming profile refresh** — refresh button now resolves members one-by-one with live progress instead of batch-then-render
- **Inline add form removed** — replaced by dedicated Add Members page accessible via header button

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Groups feature** — full CRUD for user-defined groups (`groups` + `group_members` tables), with `/groups` list page and `/groups/[id]` detail page featuring sortable table, search filter, and Twitter export import (drag-and-drop `following.js`)
- **Twitter profile cache** — shared `twitter_profiles` table with `ProfilesRepo` for global caching of Twitter user data; auto-upserts on every `getUserInfo` and batch resolve call
- **Profile refresh** — `POST /api/profiles/refresh` for manual profile snapshot updates; per-member refresh buttons on both Watchlist cards and Groups table rows with spinning indicator
- **Batch user resolution** — `POST /api/explore/users/batch` for bulk username lookup (up to 500); powers import dialogs and profile refresh flows
- **Profile linking** — `link-profiles` API for both watchlists and groups; automatically resolves `twitter_id` FK from cached profiles
- **Import from Twitter export** — drag-and-drop or file picker for `following.js` data export files on both Following and Groups pages; `parseTwitterExportFile()` extracted to shared lib
- **Zhe.to integration** — settings page at `/integrations/zheto` with API key management, and save-to-zheto button in watchlist post-card action bar
- **Quote count metric** — `quote_count` added to tweet card stats row
- **71 new unit tests** — 48 for GroupsRepo/GroupMembersRepo, 23 for ProfilesRepo

### Changed

- **Sidebar restructured** — Watchlists and Groups promoted to top-level collapsible sections (matching `NavGroupSection` style); Following page replaced by Groups; Integrations added as new nav group
- **MemberCard enriched** — displays profile avatar, display name, verified badge, follower count, bio snippet, and tags from cached `twitter_profiles` data
- **Batch resolve limit** raised from 100 to 500 usernames per request

### Fixed

- **TweAPI domain** — migration script corrected from `tweapi.com` to `api.tweapi.io` with proper camelCase field name mapping
- **Batch import errors** — error messages now expose actual server response instead of generic failure text
- **Sidebar section styling** — icons removed from Watchlists/Groups section headers; padding aligned with NavGroupSection

## [1.2.4] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **ScopedDB class** — user-scoped database access layer (`ScopedDB`) that binds `userId` at construction time, making row-level security correct by construction; eliminates per-repository `userId` parameter passing
- **SQLite adapter for NextAuth** — custom adapter (`auth-adapter.ts`) resolves user identity via `account` table JOIN on `(provider, providerAccountId)`, providing stable user IDs across browsers and sessions
- **Auth context with React.cache** — `getAuthUser()` uses `React.cache` for per-request session deduplication, avoiding redundant `auth()` calls within a single request
- **Full Playwright E2E suite** — smoke tests, auth enforcement for all routes/methods, watchlist CRUD lifecycle, member CRUD with tag flows, settings/AI config/webhook CRUD, and watchlist fetch SSE flow

### Changed

- **Repository → ScopedDB migration** — all API routes, translation service, and 10+ test files migrated from the old repository pattern to ScopedDB
- **Tweet card author row** — split into two lines for improved readability
- **Husky hooks** — restructured to match 4-layer test architecture spec; BDD E2E removed from pre-push hook (run on-demand)
- **Playwright port** — changed L4 playwright port from 17028 to 27028
- **Strict ESLint rules** — added stricter lint rules to eslint config
- Old repository modules deleted (superseded by ScopedDB)

### Fixed

- **Watchlist card instability** — stabilized post cards during fetch/translate pipeline: `pipelinePhaseRef` replaces `pipelinePhase` in useEffect deps, removed `hadCleanup` loadPosts trigger, excluded dynamic fields from masonry height estimation, added post-pipeline reconciliation fetch, and `id DESC` tiebreaker on DB queries
- **User identity resolution** — resolve user by email to prevent cross-browser auth failures caused by NextAuth generating random UUIDs without an adapter
- **Legacy users without account rows** — handle `OAuthAccountNotLinked` error for users created before the adapter migration
- **E2E FK constraint** — seed E2E user row to satisfy foreign key constraints on write operations
- **8 Playwright failures** — strict locators and test isolation fixes for sidebar link ambiguity and cross-file state leaks
- **Non-null assertions** — removed all `!` assertions from production code, agent, and scripts
- **Single video/GIF layout** — render single video or GIF full-width instead of horizontal scroll
- **Container SIGTERM** — bypass bun script runner to avoid SIGTERM error message on container stop

### Documentation

- 4-layer testing improvement plan and batch 2 completion status
- ScopedDB migration retrospective entries (18–23)
- README updated with preview image, vinext badge, and ScopedDB architecture

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Smart photo grid layout** — tweet media now uses intelligent grid layouts based on photo count: 1 photo full-width, 2 photos side-by-side, 3 photos left-large + right-two-small, 4 photos 2×2 grid; horizontal scroll only kicks in at 5+ photos or mixed media types (video/GIF)
- **Image lightbox** — clicking any photo opens a fullscreen popup with the high-res image, dark overlay (`bg-black/80`), close button, ESC key support, and click-outside-to-close
- **E2E test coverage** — new tests for watchlist detail pages, logs API, AI settings, webhooks pages, and auth enforcement across watchlist/settings/tags routes

### Fixed

- **SSE post overwrite** — `loadPosts` no longer overwrites posts that were injected mid-stream by SSE events
- **Auto-translate on zero new posts** — translation now triggers after fetch even when all posts are deduplicated (`newPosts=0`)
- **E2E stability** — increased pre-push hook timeout to 60s, added port cleanup and server reuse to E2E setup
- Removed unused `totalNewPosts` variable and stale `eslint-disable` comment for undefined `react-hooks` rule

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Translation concurrency pool** — batch translation now processes up to 3 posts concurrently via `Promise.allSettled`, applied to both SSE stream and `translateBatch()` paths
- **Load-more pagination** — posts page renders 100 posts initially with a "load more" button, reducing DOM bloat and scroll jank on large watchlists
- **Wide-screen column layout** — `useColumns()` hook supports 5 columns (≥1536px) and 6 columns (≥1920px), with a height bonus (+1 col on ≥1200px tall screens, capped at 6)

### Fixed

- **Auto-translate on JSON fallback** — `translateEnabledRef` now synced immediately in `loadData()` (not deferred to useEffect); JSON fallback path in `doFetch` also triggers auto-translate
- **Infinite re-render under vinext** — watchlist list page uses `routerRef` pattern to prevent `useRouter()` instability from causing re-render loops
- **SSE mid-stream loadPosts** — `loadPosts()` deferred until SSE stream completes instead of firing during cleanup
- **25k redundant renders during SSE** — `WatchlistPostCard`, `TweetCard`, and `MemberCard` wrapped in `React.memo`; `displayTweet` IIFE replaced with `useMemo` for referential equality
- **Polling timer rebuilds** — removed `doFetch` from polling timer deps to prevent unnecessary timer teardown/setup
- **useColumns resize overhead** — switched from `resize` event listener to `matchMedia` change listeners for fewer callbacks
- **Filtered members recomputation** — memoized filtered members array to avoid re-computing on unrelated state changes
- **Font size inconsistency** — unified quoted tweets and AI insight to `text-sm`
- **Legacy DB migration** — moved `watchlist_id`-dependent indexes after `safeAddColumn` to fix missing-column errors on pre-existing databases
- **fetch_logs DDL** — removed premature `watchlist_id` from CREATE TABLE and relocated its index after `safeAddColumn`

### Changed

- **Shortest-column masonry layout** — replaced round-robin distribution with shortest-column-first algorithm using estimated card heights for visually balanced columns
- Removed diagnostic `console.log` statements from `initSchema`

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-01

### Security

- **Cross-tenant data leak** — `findByMemberId` now scoped to `watchlistId`, preventing member posts from leaking across watchlists
- **Cross-watchlist access** — member update/delete and single-post translate routes now validate `watchlistId` ownership
- **SQL injection** — `seedUser()` switched from string interpolation to parameterized queries
- **Tag ownership bypass** — tag assignment on member create/update now validates tags belong to the authenticated user

### Added

- **Auto-translate toggle** — watchlist create/edit dialogs include a `translateEnabled` switch; fetch pipeline respects this setting and skips translation when disabled
- **Page Visibility API** — polling timer pauses when the browser tab is hidden and resumes on focus
- **AbortController** — all in-flight `fetch()` requests are cancelled on component unmount, preventing state updates on destroyed components
- **Settings error feedback** — interval and retention save failures now revert the optimistic UI update and show a 3-second error banner
- **SSE disconnect detection** — fetch and translate SSE streams detect client disconnection and abort expensive server work early
- **Database indexes** — added performance indexes on `fetched_posts(member_id, user_id, tweet_created_at)`, `watchlist_members(user_id, watchlist_id)`, and `fetch_logs(watchlist_id)`
- **Unique constraint** — `(watchlist_id, twitter_username)` uniqueness enforced at DB level to prevent duplicate members

### Fixed

- **Infinite re-render loop** — stabilized `useRouter()` and `members` refs to break `useCallback` → `useEffect` dependency cascade (vinext compatibility)
- **N+1 tag queries** — replaced per-member `getTagsForMember()` with batch `batchGetTagsForMembers()` using `inArray()`
- **JSON.parse crashes** — wrapped 5 locations parsing `tweetJson`/`errors` fields in try-catch to prevent 500 on corrupted data
- **Transaction atomicity** — `setTags()` (delete+insert) and `insertMany()` (batch insert) now wrapped in SQLite transactions
- **Schema ordering** — `fetch_logs` table creation moved before `safeAddColumn` and `migrateToMultiWatchlist` to prevent "no such table" errors on fresh databases
- **safeAddColumn** — non-duplicate-column errors are now surfaced via `console.error` instead of silently swallowed
- Stale `eslint-disable` comments removed; unused variables cleaned up
- Husky hooks updated to include `ui/` test directory

### Changed

- E2E tests rewritten for multi-watchlist API routes
- Watchlist monolith decomposed into listing, detail, and logs pages
- API routes migrated to `/api/watchlists/[id]/*` nested structure
- Dynamic watchlist group added to sidebar with icon picker (24 curated Lucide icons)
- Repository layer migrated to `watchlistId` scoping

- **AI settings** — provider registry (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, GLM, DeepSeek, Grok, Ollama), settings page with sidebar nav, KV table for config persistence
- **Fetched posts pipeline** — POST `/api/watchlist/fetch` route with tweet dedup via UNIQUE index on `(user_id, tweet_id)`, batch insert with `onConflictDoNothing`, SQL `count()`
- **SSE streaming** — real-time fetch progress via Server-Sent Events with per-member status updates
- **AI translation** — 信达雅-style Chinese translation with editorial comment (锐评) from a world-class editor's perspective; per-card translate button for on-demand single-post translation
- **Quoted tweet support** — full quoted tweet display (avatar, verified badge, timestamp, text, media, metrics) and translation with `[引用翻译]` section; new `quoted_translated_text` DB column
- **Media proxy** — server-side proxy at `/api/media/proxy` to bypass Twitter CDN hotlink protection (Referer/Origin blocking)
- **Retention system** — `retentionDays` setting with auto-purge in fetch route, `purgeOlderThan` repository method
- **Fetch logs** — `fetch_logs` table with DB persistence, API route, and logs page
- **Test coverage** — translation service unit tests, fetched-posts repository tests, fetch-logs repository tests, API route tests (fetch, settings, posts, translate), E2E tests for auto-fetch lifecycle and media proxy endpoint, real LLM round-trip E2E tests for AI settings via GLM

### Changed

- **Row-first masonry layout** — replaced CSS `columns` (column-first fill) with `useColumns()` hook using `matchMedia` for responsive breakpoints (1/2/3/4 cols) and round-robin distribution
- **Posts tab** — renamed from previous tab name, constrained post cards to `max-w-2xl`, replaced translation overlay with inline text swap and zh/en toggle
- **Member card avatars** enlarged to 1.6x (90px)
- **Language toggle** moved from global to per-post card button; default post language is `zh`
- Posts sorted by `tweetCreatedAt` (newest tweet first) instead of `fetchedAt`
- Webhooks and AI prompt extracted into dedicated `/webhooks` page
- GLM model updated from `glm-4.5` to `glm-4.7`

### Fixed

- Card border unified across tweet/comment/action bar with subtle shadow
- Fade-out mask on metrics row when card width is narrow
- Sidebar pathname deferred to avoid SSR hydration mismatch
- Select dropdowns use `appearance-none` with custom chevron icon; padding adjusted to prevent arrow clipping
- Safe `ALTER TABLE` migrations for `fetch_interval_minutes`, `comment_text`, and `quoted_translated_text` columns on pre-existing databases
- vinext compatibility: use plain `Request` instead of `NextRequest` in route handlers (`new URL(req.url).searchParams`)
- Redundant AI prefix removed from watchlist tag names
- Tweet author and metrics corrected in watchlist report
- Stale `eslint-disable` comments for missing `react-hooks` plugin removed
- Husky hooks updated to include missing test files

- Docker build fails on `better-sqlite3` native module — added `python3 make g++` build tools and `trustedDependencies` in `package.json`
- Credits page crashes with `toLocaleString() of undefined` — added three-layer defense: provider fallback defaults, data type validation, render-time nullish coalescing

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Dashboard API full integration** — all 20 TweAPI endpoints (18 Twitter + 2 Credits) now accessible from the dashboard
- **Sidebar navigation** — reorganized into "Explore World" (public, API-key-only) and "My Account" (cookie-required) groups

### Fixed

- `bun:sqlite` module resolution in E2E tests (use `bun --bun next dev`)
- `next dev` crashes with `Cannot find module 'bun:sqlite'` — added `better-sqlite3` fallback with `isBun` runtime detection (aligned with surety/life.ai pattern)
- Explore route `GET /api/explore/users/tweets` now correctly handles the `q` query parameter
- Next.js standalone `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` binding for container deployments
- Railway DOCKERFILE builder exec-mode `startCommand` issue
